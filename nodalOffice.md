### How to create a new Node ###
Every nodal office fulfills a number of functions from being a representative for Farms and Farmers to being a warehouse location. Hence, creating a node requires entering a lot of information. 

##### Step 1: Create a new physical location for the node #####

Navigate to ```Sales --> Customers --> Create```

1. Between Individual and Company, select Individual
2. Enter Name of the Node
3. Select Company as Farms and Farmers from the drop down
4. Change address type from Contact to Other address, and fill in the address of the new Node
5. Enter phone, mobile and email, leave the other fields blank
5. Move to the Sales and Purchases tab and untick the ```Is a Customer``` field. **This step is very important**. Save the details. 

##### Step 2: Designate the new node as a new department #####

Navigate to ```Employees --> Offices --> Create```

* Department Name - Enter the name of the Node
* Parent Department - Select Administration
* Manager - If the new node Manager has not been added as an employee, then this node should be managed by someone from the head office or administration. Once a [new employee](How to create a new employee.md) has been created, we can change the manager later. 
* Save

**Note** *Please note that node information is now input in two places - as a physical address and as an organization department. One should be careful to check at both places while making any changes.*
