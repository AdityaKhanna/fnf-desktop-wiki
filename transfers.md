There are three kinds of stock movements 
1. Receipts - When we receive goods from our vendors, or returns from our customers
2. Internal transfers - when we transfer goods within our network from one warehouse to another
3. Delivery - when we need to transfer stock to Dehaat coordinators or Farmers

Hence there are three types of locations - 
Vendor locations
Internal locations - Node and warehouse addresses
Customer locations - Dehaat and Farmer addresses
