# Welcome

Welcome to the FnF Desktop app wiki! Here you'll find information about how to use the application for carrying out different tasks. This wiki is evolving just as the software itself is, so watch out for constant monitoring.

## Wiki features
I would try and update this wiki with information on each change that I carry out, giving an explanation of what I've understood and on the basis of that, what I've done.

To begin with, lets see how the application is to be used for managing all the [Sales](sales.md) operations. Alternatively, you could also choose to understand some other functionality that has been implemented by visiting the following pages directly. 

[Employees](How to create a new employee.md)

[Nodes](Nodal Office.md)

[Products](New Product.md)

[Sales](sales.md)

[Inventory management](transfers.md)
